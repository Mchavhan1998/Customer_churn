# ðŸ“‚ Customer_churn
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn data to identify key factors contributing to customer attrition and building predictive models to forecast churn.

## ðŸ›  Skills
Data Analysis, Python, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Supervised learning 

## ðŸ“š Project Details
### Data Exploration and Preprocessing
- Loaded and cleaned the customer churn dataset.
  Extracted specific columns and filtered data based on conditions.
### Visualizations and Insights
- Aggregated and visualized data to understand the distribution of Internet service categories.
  Analyzed key factors affecting customer churn.
### Predictive Modeling
#### Decision Tree Classifier:
- Built a decision tree model with tenure as the independent variable.
  Split the data into train and test sets with an 80:20 ratio.
  Achieved a significant accuracy score and validated the model using a confusion matrix.
#### Random Forest Classifier:
- Built a random forest model with tenure and monthly charges as independent variables.
  Split the data into train and test sets with a 70:30 ratio.
  Achieved a significant accuracy score and validated the model using a confusion matrix.
